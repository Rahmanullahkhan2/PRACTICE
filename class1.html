    <p>Write a <b>JavaScript </b> program that creates a class called 'Animal' with properties <br>
        for species and sound. Include a method to make the animal's sound. Create a <br>
        subclass called 'Dog' thatb <br>  inherits from the 'Animal' class and adds an additional <br> 
        property for color. Override the make sound method to include the dog's color. <br>
        Create an instance of the 'Dog' class and make it make its sound.</p>
